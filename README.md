# StrictYAML Executable Specification

* Currently still very much a work in progress.
* Contains examples of both valid and invalid StrictYAML.
* All examples are executed against a reference implementation in python (the basis for StrictYAML 2.0).
* The executable specification is decoupled from the language and it should be possible to use it to test implementations in *any* language (that runs code in docker).
